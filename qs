Do we need to configure server with options (on which address/port to listen, etc.)?
Logs?
Error resposes?
Do we need other methods apart from "compress" and "extract"?
tests?
what if archive already exists?
Is api only json?
Should response be json as well?
What if there are less than 10 files, do we take all there is?
What do we do with the subdirectories in the directory we are compressing
